Saharsh sits alone in the middle rows, flipping the corner of his notebook out of habit.

When he looks up, he spots someone hesitating near the aisle—
a guy with a reusable bottle in hand, scanning the room for a seat.

Their eyes meet for a second longer than expected.
The name tag on the bottle guy reads: “Calvin”.

Something small flickers in Saharsh’s chest, like curiosity stretching awake.`,

Saharsh reaches up toward a textbook at the same time someone else turns the corner.

Saharsh watches the guy next to him frown at his screen, clearly fighting a login error.

Calvin looks up, startled, then laughs like he needed the help more than he’ll admit.`,
